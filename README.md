# 🚀 med-trial-iq

med-trial-iq aims to simplify and improve the process of matching patients to clinical trials by using generative AI and healthcare interoperability standards like FHIR. We aim to reduce manual screening efforts by automating the extraction of eligibility criteria from trial documents and intelligently mapping them to electronic medical record (EMR) data, both structured and unstructured.
